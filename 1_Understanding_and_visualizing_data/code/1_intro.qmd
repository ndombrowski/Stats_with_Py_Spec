A great resource that you can explore is the [This is Statistics website](https://thisisstatistics.org), created by the American Statistical Association. This insightful and motivating campaign has countless links, videos, and resources to raise awareness of the wide variety of fascinating careers within statistics. 


## Definitions

- The **mean (average)** of a data set is found by adding all numbers in the data set and then dividing by the number of values in the set. Its highly affected by outliers.
- The **median** is the middle value when a data set is ordered from least to greatest. 
- The mode is the number that occurs most often in a data set.


- **Range**: the difference between the highest and lowest values. 
- **Interquartile range**: the range of the middle half of a distribution. Q3-Q3
- **Standard deviation**: average distance from the mean.


## Standard Score (Empirical Rule)

In statistics, the **standard score** is the number of standard deviations by which the value of a raw score (i.e., an observed value or data point) is above or below the mean value of what is being observed or measured.

It is calculated by subtracting the population mean from an individual raw score and then dividing the difference by the population standard deviation.

Standard scores are most commonly called **z-scores**.

A bell-shaped or normal distributions is sometimes referred to as the **68-95-99.7 rule**: 68% of the observations are within 1 standard deviation of the mean. 95% of the observations are within 2 standard deviation of the mean. 99.7% of the observations are within 3 standard deviation of the mean.
